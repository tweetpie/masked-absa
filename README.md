# Masking The Bias : From Echo Chambers to Large Scale Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
Welcome to the **Masked Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis** repository. This project addresses the challenges of scarcity and high costs associated with manual annotation in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) by utilizing weak supervision methods. We have demonstrated the superiority of our model using SemEval datasets and real-world tweet data.
